# Claude Code Instructions

Full project context is in [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md). Read it before working on any task.

## Development Workflow

The CLI entry point is `percona-obs` (bash wrapper, no file extension).
The Python implementation lives in the `percona_obs/` package.
The virtualenv is at `venv/` — use it for all tooling commands.

**If `venv/` does not exist, create it and install dependencies before doing anything else:**

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**After every code change, always run both tools in this order:**

```sh
venv/bin/black percona_obs/     # format
venv/bin/pyright                # type-check
```

Both must pass (black: "N files reformatted" or "N files left unchanged"; pyright: "0 errors") before considering the task done.

## Reading the source

**Before working on any task that involves the `percona_obs/` package, read the relevant source files first.** Do not propose or make changes to code you have not read. The key files are listed in the table below — read the ones that are in scope for the task before suggesting anything.

## Implementation Planning

**Before changing any code, always write an implementation plan and show it to the user for approval.** Only proceed with code changes after the user has explicitly approved the plan. This applies to all non-trivial changes (new features, refactors, multi-file edits).
